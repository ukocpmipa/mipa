Whether developed in-house, or bought from a third party, it’s imperative that indirect providers use platforms which are enabled to take advantage of the developing capabilities of the CSP program. As new SKUs (such as Azure RIs) are added, resellers look immediately to use them. Opportunities can be won or lost by an indirect provider’s ability to fulfil. If the platform is out of date, an indirect provider may lose business to the competition whose platform is not.\n\nExamples\n\nScoring"

Providing technology thought leadership is just one example of this and it can take many forms.\n\nExamples\n\nThere is no single activity required to satisfy this recommendation since there are many ways to build and engage with a community. There are some ‘good to practice’ examples which may help you to understand the intent.\n\nBlog\n\nIf you have technical experts such as solution architects, developers, technology strategists, etc. it can be useful to have them contribue to a company blog. Through the publishing of regular blog posts, these people can share exciting and innovative solutions they build or discover. They can tell stories of customer and partner success. They can also share solutions to common challenges, or references to useful materials they’ve discovered as they’ve learned.\n\nThe advantage of maintaining this as a company blog is that the content can be shared and re-shared many times, across many channels. The knowledge built up in the body of posts because a useful reference to others and serves as a way to reduce the overheard of repeatedly answering the same questions.\n\nIf you’re developing a solution using modern development methodologies and tooling, sharing your journey can be a powerful way to demonstrate to others how to do it.\n\nPodcast\n\nVlogging\n\nEvent speaking\n\nScoring"

What helps differentiate them is the level of competency they’ve achieved.\n\nCompetencies are an endorsement of a Partner’s skills, experience and investment in the Microsoft ecosystem, and they bring with them benefits others do have access to. It’s therefore important to invest time in attaining them as means of demonstrating to your Partner channel that you have the foundational knowledge to support them in their learning and development of new Microsoft practices.\n\nExamples\n\nScoring"

In this tutorial, we give non-developers an easy way to update Jekyll sites with CloudCannon.\n\nWhat is CloudCannon?\n\nCloudCannon is cloud content management system and hosting provider for Jekyll websites. A developer uploads a Jekyll site in the browser or by syncing with GitHub, Bitbucket or Dropbox. CloudCannon then builds the site, hosts it and provides an interface for non-technical users to update content.\n\nSetup\n\nTo begin, we need to create a CloudCannon account and create our first site. Head over to CloudCannon and click the Get Started Free button:\n\nEnter your details into the sign up form:\n\nOnce we’ve signed up we’re taken to our dashboard. Click Create Site:\n\nEnter a name for the site. I’m going to use the site from the Converting a static site to Jekyll cast so I’ll call it Creative:\n\nThis creates the site and gives us options for uploading our files. If you’d like to use the same site I’m using you can download it here.\n\nThere’s a number of ways of getting your files on CloudCannon. To keep things simple we’re just going to upload a folder from our local computer. Click on the folder icon. Note: folder upload is only supported in Chrome\n\nNavigate to your Jekyll site and click Upload:\n\nOnce the files upload, CloudCannon builds the site:\n\nWe can view the live site by clicking on the .cloudvent.net URL in the sidebar:\n\nEditables\n\nNext, we need to do is to define areas in our HTML which non-developers can update. These are called Editable Regions and are set by adding a class of editable to HTML elements.\n\nOpen index.html in CloudCannon and add a class of editable to the h1 and p inside &lt;div class=\"header-content-inner\"&gt; so it becomes the following:\n\n&lt;div class=\"header-content-inner\"&gt;\n  &lt;h1 class=\"editable\"&gt;Your Favorite Source of Free Bootstrap Themes&lt;/h1&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n  &lt;p class=\"editable\"&gt;Start Bootstrap can help you build better websites using the Bootstrap CSS framework! Just download your template and start going, no strings attached!&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;a href=\"/about.html\" class=\"btn btn-primary btn-xl page-scroll\"&gt;Find Out More&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\nClient Access\n\nNow the site is ready for our non-developer to update. We’ll set up Client Sharing which allows our client to update their site without having to create an account. Go to the Site Settings / Client Sharing section and set a password for your client.\n\nOur non-developer can view their live site at your-site.cloudvent.net (or you can set up a custom domain). To update their site they just add /update to the URL and enter the password we set earlier.\n\nThe Client Workflow\n\nOnce the client logs in they see their site with colored boxes highlighting the editable regions. The client can update content directly inline by clicking on text:\n\nBy clicking Collections in the sidebar the client can manage their blog posts:\n\nEditing posts happens in the Content Editor which is a rich text editor for Markdown. The client can also manage all the front matter data on the page using an easy-to-use editor:\n\nOr we can use the Visual Editor to update posts:\n\nThe client can also update collection items using the same editor. In this example there’s no body content and only front matter so we’ve made the front matter editor full screen:\n\nIf we have GitHub, Bitbucket or Dropbox connected to the site, all changes the client makes are pushed back to the storage provider.\n\nNow the client can update all the content and hasn’t had to learn HTML, Liquid or Markdown. This gives a small taste of what you can achieve on CloudCannon. Sign up free and make your Jekyll site client editable."
